## What is a Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack is

- `Push` - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- `Pop` - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- `Top` - This is the top of the stack.
- `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- `IsEmpty` - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

**Stacks follow these concepts**:

**FILO** - First In Last Out

> This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO** - Last In First Out

> This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Stack Visualization

the topmost item is denoted as the `top`. When you push something to the stack, it becomes the new `top`. When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current `top` and set the next `top` as `top.next`.

## Push O(1)

When adding a Node, you `push` it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its `next` property equal to the original `top`.

**Pseudo Code For `Push`**

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

## Pop O(1)

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a `pop`, the `top` Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the `top` Node is returned to the user.

> Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `pop`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

**Pseudo Code For `Pop`**

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

## Peek O(1)

When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `top` Node of the stack.

**Pseudo code for a `peek`**

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

We do not re-assign the `next` property when we `peek` because we want to keep the reference to the next Node in the stack. This will allow the `top` to stay the top until we decide to `pop`.

## IsEmpty O(1)

**Pseudo code for `isEmpty`**

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

## What is a Queue

Common terminology for a queue is

- **Enqueue** - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- **Dequeue** - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **Front** - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- **Rear** - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

## Enqueue O(1)

When you add an item to a queue, you use the `enqueue` action. This is done with an `O(1)` operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue `(n)`; it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

**Pseudo code for the `enqueue`**

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

## Dequeue O(1)

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the `dequeue` action. This is done with an `O(1)` operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the `front` Node of the queue.

**Pseudo code for the `dequeue`**

```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
   ```

## Peek O(1)

When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `front` Node of the queue.

**Pseudo code for a `peek`**

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

> We do not re-assign the `next` property when we `peek` because we want to keep the reference to the next Node in the queue. This will allow the `front` to stay in the front until we decide to `dequeue`

## IsEmpty O(1)

**Pseudo code for `isEmpty`**

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
