To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

***A framework can solve these problems, however said framework must have the right level of abstraction as well as a great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.***


Next.js has the best-in-class "Developer Experience" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:

- An intuitive [page-based](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) routing system (with support for [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes))
- [Pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), both [static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) (SSG) and [server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- [Client-side routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction#linking-between-pages) with optimized prefetching
- [Built-in CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass support](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support), and support for any [CSS-in-JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js) library
- Development environment with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) support
- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions 
- Fully extendable
