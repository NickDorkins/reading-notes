## [Intro](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial#id4)

`matplotlib` is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.

## IPython and the pylab mode

[IPython](http://ipython.org/) is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more.

> When we start it with the command line argument `-pylab` (`--pylab` since IPython version 0.12), it allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

## pyplot

pyplot is an object oriented plotting library, it is modeled closely to Matlab<sup>TM</sup>.
