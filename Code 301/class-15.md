In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

- 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women
- 2016 - 18% 

According to a recent study conducted by Glassdoor, 11 of the 25 best-paying jobs are technology related, with an average earning potential of between $106,000 and $130,000 a year. 

## Marketing games

A lot of early computers were used for game playing

Those games tended to be more aimed more at boys and men, so it was easy for boys to get a leg up in that area through gaming

the Apple personal computer that was released at the time was marketed specifically to boys (included them teasing girls’ computer skills), as were a whole range of other consoles.

> It’s no coincidence that the console touted to have saved the industry was called a “Game Boy

The few women who do make it into the field are far less likely to stay than their male counterparts.

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders

Meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. 

> According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

## Diverse companies perform better

researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

At Paradigm, they have collected data that demonstrates biased hiring practices can significantly affect the ways in which candidates from underrepresented backgrounds are evaluated in the recruiting process.

## Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 

When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.

> Tracy Chou of Pinterest shared the company’s demographic information last year, she explained: "We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant."

## It’s the right thing to do 

While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, USA Today spoke with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.
